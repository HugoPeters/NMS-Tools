# NMS-Tools
Set of tools for No Man's Sky.

## NMS-Extract
Extractor that automatically scans a directory (should be the PCBANKS folder) for .pak's and extracts them neatly in an output folder.

## NMS-View
![o shit whaddup](http://i.imgur.com/vMc0eLS.png)
Model viewer for .GEOMETRY.MBIN.PC files. Currently very basic, but I'm planning to add support for:

* More complex models (seems like some complex models are somewhat corrupted)
* Better model loading (please report failing models in general)
* Materials
* Scene Graph
* Skeleton & animation (..maybe later..)
* More MBIN structures
